# Intellectual Property Violation Policy

This intellectual property violation policy outlines how the MapLibre Organization plans to react in case a person should commit a copyright infringement.

## Definitions

**Violator**: A person who violated intellectual property rights by committing illegally copied code to the MapLibre codebase.

## Steps

Should we detect a copyright infringement, our reaction will be the following:

* Contact Open Source Collective, MapLibre's fiscal host, and inform them that illegally copied code was detected in the MapLibre codebase.
* Contact the owner of the intellectual property and inform them that illegally copied code was detected in the MapLibre codebase.
* Contact the violator and inform them of the consequences of their action.
* The action against the violator shall be to do the following for up to 3 months in case of a first infringement and up to 2 years in case of repeated infringement:
  * Block the violator from any interaction with the MapLibre community on GitHub, i.e. they are not allowed to open or participate in any pull requests, issues, or discussions.
  * Block the violator from participating in the Technical Steering Committee meetings.
* Make a public statement that illegally copied code was detected in the MapLibre codebase and communicate what the next steps will be, link to this policy.
* Start a public and transparent process of how we plan to remove the illegally copied code from the MapLibre codebase and inform all involved parties on a regular basis about the progress.
