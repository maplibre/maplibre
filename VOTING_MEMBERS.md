# MapLibre Voting Members

The MapLibre Voting Members elect the Governing Board.
Voting Members are people who contributed to MapLibre in a non-trivial way and we intentionally leave the definition of non-trivial to the community to decide.
New people can become Voting Members if they are nominated by a Voting Member and are subsequently elected by a majority of the Voting Members.
A single organization can have at most 3 MapLibre Voting Members because we aim for a broad community representation.
