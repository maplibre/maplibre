# Project Tiers

The MapLibre Organization maintains the map rendering frameworks MapLibre GL JS and MapLibre GL Native and fosters an ecosystem of plugins and tools around these libraries to produce the best maps in the world.

The project tiers Core and Hosted describe qualitatively how organization resources are distributed among the projects.

## Tiers

### Core Project

A project that the MapLibre Organization is committed to long-term. A substantial amount of resources is allocated to the project in the form of paid Maintainer time and paid Bounties to ensure its long-term success.

### Supported Project

A project that the MapLibre Organization can allocate a limited amount of resources to, on an ad-hoc basis, to ensure its long-term success.

### Hosted Project

A project that the MapLibre Organization does not allocate any resources to. The project is hosted in the MapLibre GitHub organization to facilitate collaboration between the people who are interested in the project.

## Process

New projects start in the Hosted tier.

If you would like to propose to change the tier of a project, please edit this file in a pull request.

Changing the tier of a project requires approval by the MapLibre Governing Board, as the Board is responsible for all financial decisions.
